# Xdc Connect - `Functionality`

This documentation enlists the various event listeners & interface APIs exported from `xdc-connect`

## Listeners

XDC-CONNECT allows user to listen for state changes by providing the listeners as `props`.  
Currently you can listen for the following updates in your component :

1. On Wallet Connect - `onConnect`
2. On Wallet Disconnect - `onDisconnect`
3. On Address Change - `onAddressChange`

Each listener will be called with a parameter of `wallet` which represents the state of the connected xdc wallet post the event trigger.

### On Connect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully connects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

### On Disconnect

Event is triggered when any of the loader successfully disconnects with application. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

### On Address Change

Event is triggered when any of the loader changes the default **XDC** address. The listener willl be called with an `wallet` object.

## APIs

1. **GetWallet** - returns promise which will resolve into `wallet` object.
2. **GetNativeBalance** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc balance.
3. **SendTransaction** - returns promise which will resolve into xdc3 `receipt` for the transaction.
4. **CallTransaction** - returns promise which will resolve into response for the transaction.
5. **Disconnect** - disconnect the app with user's wallet provider.

## Arguments



<ArgsTable of={XdcConnect} />

## Examples

### OnConnect

Fired when user successfully connects their wallet. It passed an updated instance of user's wallet.

```
import React from "react";
import { XdcConnect } from "xdc-connect";
import "./App.css";
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <XdcConnect
        btnClass="btn btn-rounded btn-success"
        btnName="Custom Text"
        onConnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected wallet", wallet);
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App 
```

### onDisconnect

Fired when user successfully logouts/disconnects their wallet.

### onAddressChange

Fired when user changes their default address from providers like XinPay.

## APIs

The library also exposes APIs to interact with the wallet provider which are as follows:

1. GetWallet - returns promise which will resolve into wallet object.
2. GetNativeBalance - returns promise which will resolve into xdc balance.
3. SendTransaction - returns promise which will resolve into xdc3 receipt for the transaction.
4. CallTransaction - returns promise which will resolve into response for the transaction.
5. Disconnect - disconnect the app with user's wallet provider.

Example:
```

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { XdcConnect, Disconnect } from "xdc-connect";
import "./App.css";
function App() {
  const [wallet, setwallet] = useState({});
console.log("wallet", wallet);
return (
    <div className="App">
      <XdcConnect
        btnClass={
          wallet.connected
            ? "btn btn-rounded btn-success"
            : "btn btn-rounded btn-warning"
        }
        btnName={wallet.connected ? "CONNECTED" : "CONNECT"}
        onConnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected wallet", wallet);
          setwallet(wallet);
        }}
        onDisconnect={(wallet) => {
          console.log("user connected disconnect", wallet);
          setwallet(wallet);
        }}
      />
      {wallet.connected ? <button onClick={Disconnect}>Logout</button> : ""}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
